# RAV4 EV BatterySpoof

This project spoofs (pretends to be) the battery management system in a
[first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_RAV4_EV#First_generation_(1997)).
It runs on an Arduino microcontroller.
The program outputs status information in the same format as the original
battery management system, so that the battery can be replaced with new cells
and the car will accept this.

It's intended to run on an
[Arduino UNO R4 Minima](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-r4-minima/), but it
can run on another Arduino board by updating the build commands in the Makefile
to use a different fully-qualified board name (FQBN).
It communicates over serial and RS232 using a shield such as
[the DFRobot RS232 shield](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1030.html).

## Setup

Install the [Arduino CLI](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli?tab=readme-ov-file)
according to [the installation instructions](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/installation/).

In the project directory, run `make init`.

## Development

Run `make build` to compile the project.
Run `make format` to auto-format code.
Run `make clean` to remove artifacts generated by `make build`.
Run `make test` to run tests.
Run `make check` to format code and run tests.

## Build/Install

TODO: create Makefile target to install on-device
